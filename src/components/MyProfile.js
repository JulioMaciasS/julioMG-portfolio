          <p>My journey with technology began in 2014 when I received a gift, a PS4. However, as gaming consoles often struggled to deliver good performance, my curiosity about computers sparked, getting a Windows gaming laptop a year later. When dealing with a computer, often, you run into problems such as the infamous Windows blue screen, the enjoyment while solving these challenges has driven my journey.</p>
